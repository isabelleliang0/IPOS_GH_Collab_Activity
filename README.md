###IPOS GitHub Collaboration Activity 

Activity 2 Session 8: (Optional) Full-cycle collaborative workflow — Automated testing documentation 

Following John's example - Robbo-lab/automated_testing_v1: Repository to set up GitHub actions. 
https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/full-cycle-ci/

These 3 activities will be part of our validation discussion in week 13.

In this exercise, everybody will:

1. Create a repository on GitHub (everybody should use a different repository name for their repository) 
2. Commit code to the repository and set up tests with GitHub Actions
3. Everybody will find a bug in their repository and open an issue in their repository 
4. Then each one will clone the repo of one of their exercise partners, fix the bug, and open a pull request (GitHub)
5. Everybody then merges their co-worker’s change
